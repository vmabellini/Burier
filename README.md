# Burier
A simple stenography tool to hide secret data inside image files

You can use Burier to hide any kind of data inside an image file, as long the image is large enough to have space to store it :)
There's a ultra-secret option for you who wants to hide some information without I/O on disk. You can direct input the text you want to hide, and use a command to read it direct from the console interface.

Type --help to see all the options!
